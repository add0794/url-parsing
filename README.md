# Parsing Characters from a URL's Table

This program uses BeautifulSoup to extract values from a URL, specifically a table containing x-coordinates, characters, and y-coordinates. It then processes these values into a NumPy array and finally creates a grid of characters based on the x- and y-coordinates. The grid is printed out with the characters placed at their respective positions.

Use this when sending encrypted messages back and forth, but make sure you know how to create a grid and which characters will display what words!
